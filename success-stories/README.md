### **Building Kenya's First Youth IGF** | 2024
**By:** Amina Said & Team | Kenya  
**Category:** Community Building

After attending the global IGF, a group of young Kenyans recognized the need for local youth voices in internet governance discussions. They launched Kenya Youth IGF in 2024, bringing together 150+ young people from across the country for a two-day forum on digital rights and policy. The event produced concrete policy recommendations that were submitted to the national IGF and resulted in two youth representatives being appointed to Kenya's IGF multistakeholder group.

**Key Takeaway:** Start small, document everything, and don't wait for perfect conditions - the community will show up if you build the space.

### **From Fellow to Policy Influencer** | 2023
**By:** Daniel Kojo | Ghana  
**Category:** Policy Influence

As an IGF Fellowship recipient, Daniel conducted research on data protection gaps in West Africa. His work caught the attention of Ghana's Data Protection Commission, leading to an invitation to contribute to national data governance guidelines. The research findings influenced three specific provisions in Ghana's updated data protection framework, particularly around youth data rights and consent mechanisms.

**Key Takeaway:** Rigorous research + strategic relationship-building = real policy impact. Fellows should actively share their work with relevant policymakers.

### **Connecting Women Across Borders** | 2023-2024
**By:** Asia-Pacific Women in Cybersecurity Collective  
**Category:** Capacity Building

What started as an informal Signal group of 15 women working in cybersecurity policy across Asia-Pacific has grown into a 200+ member network. The collective now runs monthly knowledge-sharing sessions, maintains a job board, and has successfully advocated for increased women's representation at regional IGF events. In 2024, 40% of speakers at APrIGF were women, up from 22% in 2022.

**Key Takeaway:** Informal networks can evolve into powerful advocacy platforms. Create the space first, structure can come later.
